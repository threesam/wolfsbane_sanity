Steiner brilliantly disgusts his readers by letting them know that almost everything includes animal products, “like wine and beer (isinglass, a kind of gelatin derived from fish bladders, is often used to [...] purify, these beverages), refined sugar (bone char is sometimes used to bleach it), or Band-Aids (animal products in the adhesive) [and last but not least] those little comfort strips on most razor blades contain animal fat.” (Steiner 772). As if this wasn't enough to have any meat-eater running for Whole Foods he also ruins any hope for organic living since, “chickens may be labeled free-range even if they've never been outside or seen a speck of daylight in their entire lives. And that Thanksgiving turkey? Even if it is raised ‘free-range,’ it still lives a life of pain and confinement that ends with the butcher's knife.” (Steiner 771). To top it all off he absolutely demolishes any traditional Thanksgiving dreams and replaces them with tofurky nightmares. At least Pollen provides a sense of optimism when he basically gives the end of the world eight more years. He stole his consensus from climate scientist, James Hansen, who informed the public that, “we have only ten years left to start cutting--not just slowing--the amount of carbon we’re emitting or face a ‘different planet.’ Hansen said this more than two years ago, however; two years have gone by, and nothing of consequence has been done. So: eight years left to go and a great deal left to do.” (Pollan 767). Pollan points out that the earth is worse off than it was a decade ago due to the, “Terrifying feedback [that threatens] to boost the rate of change exponentially, as the shift from White Ice to Blue Water in the Arctic absorbs more sunlight and warming soils [...] become more biologically active, causing them to release their vast stores of carbon into the air. Have you looked into the eyes of a climate scientist recently? They look really scared.” (Pollan 765)."}],"markDefs":[],"style":"normal"},{"_key":"8a1901bbbadd","_type":"block","children":[{"_key":"8a1901bbbadd0","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"Steiner and Pollan use Pathos, quite seamlessly, to pull at the heartstrings of those who cried in the movie theater during Frozen. Those who become teary-eyed when a cartoon snowman melts most likely, “denounce the ways in which [...] animals [are treated and] make impassioned calls for more ‘humanely’ raised meat. Many [...] soothe their consciences by purchasing only free-range fowl and eggs, blissfully ignorant that ‘free-range’ has very little if any practical significance.” (Steiner 771). The simple truth that free-range might not mean what it's advertising is enough to send any health fanatic into anaphylactic shock but Steiner kicks that poor soul while they are down when he tells them to, “think about that when [they are] picking out [that] free-range turkey, which has absolutely nothing to be thankful for on Thanksgiving. All it ever had was a short and miserable life, thanks to us intelligent, compassionate humans.” (Steiner 773). While that health fanatic is heaving on the floor Pollen takes the opportunity to discuss climate change, “linking our everyday acts to their real-world consequences, [and how it has become] easy for [him] to overlook the coal-fired power plant that is lighting [his computer] screen, or the mountaintop in Kentucky that had to be destroyed to provide the coal to that plant, or the streams running crimson with heavy metals as a result.” (Pollan 766). Even though climate change is an unpleasant subject to discuss Pollan lightens it up while still maintaining its importance when he states that, “the single greatest lesson the garden teaches is that our relationship to the planet need not be zero-sum, and that as long as the sun still shines and people still can plan and plant, think and do, we can, if we bother to try, find ways to provide for ourselves without diminishing the world.” (Pollan 768)."}],"markDefs":[],"style":"normal"},{"_key":"ffe475d5e65e","_type":"block","children":[{"_key":"ffe475d5e65e0","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"Steiner and Pollen utilize Ethos to shake the average reader’s sense of morality so that they feel badly about something they did not pay any mind to originally which ultimately makes them feel even worse. Society has come a long way in terms of agribusiness and mass production which is all well and good except for the fact that civilization has become less civilized because “these uses of animals are so institutionalized, so normalized, in our society that it is difficult to find the critical distance needed to see them as the horrors that they are: so many forms of subjection, servitude, and [...] outright murder.” (Steiner 772). Steiner’s work sets an example for the rest of the carnivorous population and shakes their moral compass since, “strict ethical vegans, of which [Gary Steiner is] one, are customarily excoriated for equating our society’s treatment of animals with mass murder,” (Steiner 770). Morality is embedded in the very core of most humans. The power-hungry like to justify unjust activity to the rest of the public in order to glaze over real issues and, “to justify doing nothing, but perhaps the most insidious is that, whatever we do manage to do, it will be too little too late. Climate change is upon us, and it has arrived well ahead of schedule.” (Pollan 765).

The corpse flower is technically many tiny flowers (also known as an inflorescence). These plants can live for several decades and they only bloom every 7-10 years. In the meantime, A tree-like structure protrudes from the plant sucking up the sun’s indefinite energy and stores it in its corm for the major blooming event ahead. This event only occurs for 24-48 hours at the most. During this time an incredible amount of energy is explosively released. “When a corpse flower blooms, the spadix heats up to temperatures of up to 98°F as the plant unleashes a stench akin to rotting flesh. \"Those pulses of heat cause the air to rise, like a chimney effect,\" Ray Mims, a spokesperson for the U.S. Botanic Garden, explained to Washingtonian magazine. \"It gets the stench up in the air\" to attract pollinating dung beetles and carrion beetles, who are drawn to the scent of rotting flesh.

Fairy Ring could be described as a simple fungal spot but on a much larger scale. It is a common belief in Wales that beneath Fairy Ring hides villages where fairies dwell. It’s interesting that while little was known about this fungal disease it was still thought that it’s random sprouting had something to do with the ground underneath it. And now, “Science tells us that fairy rings– or patterns of certain types of mushrooms that grow in circular formations– are [a] naturally-occurring phenomenon that usually appear year after year on lawns, in fields, and in forests. Fairy rings occur when a mushroom spore falls in a favorable spot, grows a mycelium (the vegetative part of a fungus), and spreads out an underground network of fine, tubular threads called hyphae. Mushroom caps then appear at the edges of this network. The formations continue to expand outward, using up all the nutrients within them as they grow larger,” (Garden College Magazine 2017).

The conclusion of said article is that East Antarctica is shrinking and is so far responsible for 20 percent of the continent’s ice loss. The reason why this is so worrying is because East Antarctica is thought to be one of the coldest places in the world, and has 10 times more ice than the western side of the continent. With average temperatures of -67 degrees Fahrenheit and the coldest coming in at a record-breaking -144 degrees Fahrenheit. One would naturally think that this place would be one of the last places affected by climate change, but the unfortunate reality is that with our oceans getting warmer… the ice shelves floating on top are degrading.

Said Glacier is also one of several areas in East Antarctica where ice loss is around 1,000 meters per year. The ice that falls off eventually melts into the ocean, thus raising our sea level. Coastal cities and towns will be at the most risk. Especially in poorer countries and communities. Imagine the potential loss of land and life. The thing is, this won’t happen in one cataclysmic swift move that will change everything. It will happen over decades and decades.

So since we are at winters doorstep let’s talk about some great robust houseplants to have during this upcoming winter season. With less light during winter, it can be an issue with certain house plants, so I'd suggest a pet plant such as the Chinese evergreen or Aglaonema. “Aglaonema have beautiful lush large leaves, some with patterns. Surprisingly, they can take low light and maintain their color and grow,” says Barbara Pierson, nursery manager at White Flower Farm. But if you are keeping your plant in a dim room, she recommends paying close attention to how much you water, as there’s a higher risk of overwatering. Also, if the room doesn’t receive much natural light, you can supplement sunlight with artificial light by placing your aglaonema near a lamp. (Katie Holdefehr 18’).” It’s always at least slightly beneficial to have a houseplant or two around, just to take pride in taking care of a living thing is a plus, and perhaps the very small amount of air filtration by the plant is useful.

As I mentioned before when talking about this titanosaurs ecosystem, Mapusaurus was one of the few predators that would have been capable of taking down an Argentinosaurus. Mapusaurus was a large theropod from the Carcharodontosauridae family. It’s estimated to be roughly 33 feet in length, 10-12 feet in height and weighed about 6,613 pounds! This large predator had teeth capable of tearing the flesh of its prey. But even though this is a large carnivore a lone Mapusaurus would not be able to take down an Argentinosaurus by itself. Fossil evidence suggests that Mapusaurus hunted in packs that may have consisted of 3-4 individuals. So how would a pack of Mapusuaurus take down an Argentinosaurus? Well there are two plausible theories. One theory is that the Mapusaurus pack would bite the legs and other parts of the body. By doing this it would be able to bleed out the titanosaur until it collapsed of blood loss. But that method would have taken too long and would have resulted in a longer wait for a meal. This next theory is more efficient and would have allowed for a quick meal. Instead of killing the Argentinosaurus, the Mapusaurus may have instead ripped off pieces of flesh and eaten those. This method would have allowed Mapusaurus to get in fast and leave fast, reducing the risk of injury. But even though Argentinosaurus was a large and slow animal it was more than capable of defending itself. Its long tail could have been used to hit predators and would have severely injured them, it may also have been capable of rearing up on its hind legs and stomping back down on the predator killing it instantly. As a herbivore Argentinosaurus would have lived in herds that would have deterred any predators from attacking if the herd was large."}],"markDefs":[],"style":"normal"},{"_sanityAsset":"image@file://./images/521e7091bff99b3b628f100058f8b75246f0b70d-512x341.png","_key":"3755a5417915","_type":"mainImage","alt":"Argentinosaurus","caption":"Argentinosaurus"},{"_key":"d8e0cbdafba6","_type":"block","children":[{"_key":"d8e0cbdafba60","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"Ever since it was discovered, Argentinosaurus has been a huge focus in the modern studies of maximum dinosaur sizes.

Another alternative that my family and I personally have used since we stopped using both real and fake trees is a ceramic one. It's small, needs no maintenance, no time used decorating or wiring because it's painted on and much more portable and mobile in comparison to either one of the others. One will ultimately choose whatever they want in the end, however, they should be more aware of what they're buying or at least conscious of what is cornerstone of Christmas decor."}],"markDefs":[],"style":"normal"},{"_sanityAsset":"image@file://./images/fe9a5d81e176512d86da4a7e2b716d97be058dfb-2048x1365.jpg","_key":"cabbefdde1bb","_type":"mainImage","alt":"Girl looking through branches","caption":"Girl looking through branches"},{"_key":"b57dc1aa1597","_type":"block","children":[{"_key":"b57dc1aa15970","_type":"span","marks":["strong"],"text":"Works Cited:"}],"markDefs":[],"style":"normal"},{"_key":"1bbdccf6e268","_type":"block","children":[{"_key":"1bbdccf6e2680","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"https://chemicalfreegal.com/2017/11/13/to-tree-or-not-to-tree-a-look-into-the-hidden-chemicals-in-fake-real-christmas-trees/"}],"markDefs":[],"style":"normal"},{"_key":"a9ff7bfc1a95","_type":"block","children":[{"_key":"a9ff7bfc1a950","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"https://rtkenvironmental.com/lead/warning-hidden-health-hazard-artificial-christmas-trees/"}],"markDefs":[],"style":"normal"},{"_key":"e4c91c45ce1c","_type":"block","children":[{"_key":"e4c91c45ce1c0","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"https://gonewmommy.com/2018/11/22/non-toxic-christmas-tree/"}],"markDefs":[],"style":"normal"}],"excerpt":[{"_key":"f342fe7636d2","_type":"block","children":[{"_key":"f342fe7636d20","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"Once again Christmas time is hastily approaching us and I'm sure that a lot of people are deciding if they want a real tree or if they should get a fake tree instead.

Most of us are delighted, perhaps you’ll relax poolside, or maybe on a sun porch with your feet up, head back with several incense burning to achieve a higher upper echelon of leisure.

Although incense aren’t a ubiquitous thing you see on every street corner, it’s still a very common object many have in case a meditation session is at hand. One that’s been burned for many a year, in this case, it would be from a tree called the Palo Santo tree. “The Palo Santo is a native tree to the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico, and along the Pacific coast of South America, including the Galapagos Islands. It also grows in Central America” (Jessica McGregor 18’)."}],"markDefs":[],"style":"normal"},{"_sanityAsset":"image@file://./images/f853ca542d6e30b553801c67389178adc852aa90-715x945.jpg","_key":"8dedd78b02ba","_type":"mainImage","alt":"Girl with a Palo Santo stick","caption":"Girl with a Palo Santo stick"},{"_key":"19cc660db539","_type":"block","children":[{"_key":"19cc660db5390","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"The Palo Santo tree itself has been utilized this way for a very long time. Spanish monks discovered this tree and named it Palo Santo or “holy stick” due to its healing and cleansing properties. Ever since then, it has been a spiritual item for activities such as meditation. This plant material has held not only intrinsic value but symbolic as well with such constant use and demand from its consumers. Usually, when Palo Santo is harvested it is months to even years after the tree dies naturally. Having time to ripen on the forest floor allowing for the natural oils within the wood to accumulate. However, there has been a “botanical poaching” if-you-will of these trees while still alive and healthy. Causing a need for conservation. “The tree has recently been added to Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) Appendix II, which includes species that aren’t necessarily threatened with extinction, but due to a certain level of popularity in international trade, must be controlled in order to prevent becoming threatened, endangered or extinct” (Kells Mcphillips 19’). Hopefully, this destructive trend can be slowed or stopped. Although Palo Santo sticks do in fact grow on trees, they are not an unlimited resource. Perhaps individuals should search for another tool to enhance their mediation session. Nature can’t be rushed, forced or persuaded artificially. All things require time to come to pass, this being no exception. Maybe those who are harvesting these arborous beings out of greed need a mediation session of their own."}],"markDefs":[],"style":"normal"},{"_sanityAsset":"image@file://./images/451cd20976224406127f2a3b1767d9a630f79262-6000x4000.jpg","_key":"a2760c9f7261","_type":"mainImage","alt":"Jars and herbs","caption":"Jars and herbs"},{"_key":"b6504c34fe8f","_type":"block","children":[{"_key":"b6504c34fe8f0","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"Works Cited:"}],"markDefs":[],"style":"normal"},{"_key":"727bf9102a92","_type":"block","children":[{"_key":"727bf9102a920","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"McGregor Jessica science trends https://sciencetrends.com/what-is-palo-santo/ accessed 2019"}],"markDefs":[],"style":"normal"},{"_key":"ac7977d8fdba","_type":"block","children":[{"_key":"ac7977d8fdba0","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"Mcphillips kells wellandgood.com https://www.wellandgood.com/good-home/palo-santo-tree-endangered/ accessed 2019"}],"markDefs":[],"style":"normal"}],"collection":{"_ref":"ae031de8-350c-465a-b98d-a6fd049f5f11","_type":"reference"},"excerpt":[{"_key":"8d37a185b83c","_type":"block","children":[{"_key":"8d37a185b83c0","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"Although incense aren’t a ubiquitous thing you see on every street corner, it’s still a very common object many have in case a meditation session is at hand.

In Hell Creek, T.rex was the dominant apex predator that feared nothing except its own species."}],"markDefs":[],"style":"normal"},{"_key":"e337831df910","_type":"block","children":[{"_key":"e337831df9100","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"The physiology of Tyrannosaurus is what makes it one of my favorite dinosaurs of all time, it was 40 feet in length and was 15 to 20 feet tall. It weighed anywhere from 18, 518 to 30,864 pounds, making it one of the largest theropods in mass (Yes, Spinosaurus were larger but only in size). Its body was most likely covered in scales as an adult while juveniles and possibly young sub-adults were covered in feathers and lost them as they got older. T.rex reached full size in less than 20 years and increased its size by about 1,500 pounds per year meaning it spent 90% of its life eating. Its skull was around 5 feet in length with forward-facing eyes, giving it binocular vision similar to us! This binocular vision gave it great depth-perception which allowed it to judge how far away prey was. Tyrannosaurus had large powerful jaws filled with 60 thick, conical and serrated 9-inch teeth that enabled it to crush bones with ease. These jaws gave T.rex the strongest bite force in the entire animal kingdom, an adult Tyrannosaurus could have exerted 7,869 to 12,814 pounds of force (35,000-57,000 Newtons). It also had strong muscular legs, a long muscular tail used for balance and the most well-known feature was its small muscular arms which were 3 feet in length. Contrary to belief, evidence suggests that T.rex did, in fact, use its arms as specimens have been found with signs of torn muscles on their arms. But how did T.rex use its arms? Well, theories suggest that it may have been used to help restrain prey once said prey has been bitten. For example, say a T.rex is hunting a Triceratops, Tyrannosaurus would have bitten down on the Trike preferably on the neck and then would have used its arms to grab the Trike while it tries to crush the Triceratops’s neck with its powerful jaws. Overall Tyrannosaurus is the perfect example of a living tank, it was able to take down tough prey thanks to its physiology and is arguably one of the most successful and powerful theropod dinosaurs."}],"markDefs":[],"style":"normal"},{"_key":"82fdf2dd780c","_type":"block","children":[{"_key":"82fdf2dd780c0","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"Life-Size replica of what T.rex may have looked like:"}],"markDefs":[],"style":"normal"},{"_sanityAsset":"image@file://./images/8cc686b362dbd6b8d468866b8f254ded480c17b7-4032x3024.jpg","_key":"15cb5ad6d7fd","_type":"mainImage","alt":"T.rex replica","caption":"T.rex replica"},{"_key":"807476852485","_type":"block","children":[{"_key":"8074768524850","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"While T.rex was certainly a powerful and efficient predator, some paleontologists in the field believe T.rex was a strict scavenger due to it being slow; estimated speeds being between 10 to 25 mph but it could only run at these speeds for a short period of time due to it taking a lot of energy for something that big to move so fast. I, on the other hand, believe Tyrannosaurus was an opportunistic predator.

Edmontosaurus was a large hadrosaur or as people know them: duck-billed dinosaurs. Two Edmontosaur specimens have been found with evidence of being attacked by a Tyrannosaurus and both had survived the encounter due to signs of healing being found on the bones. But with it being slow how was it able to catch fast prey such as Edmontosaurus? Well, T.rex most likely relied on ambushing its prey, waiting to get close then striking. So in this scenario let’s picture a herd of Edmontosaurus grazing in a lightly forested field and hiding in the trees is a Tyrannosaurus rex. The T.rex would slowly move towards them while keeping an eye out for an older member of the herd since they would be easier to catch, unlike a young adult. As it is moving towards the herd one Edmontosaur makes the mistake of turning its back to the trees, this is when the T.rex strikes and as soon as the Edmontosaur turns its head back the T.rex is already charging at it. Before the Edmontosaurus starts to run the T.rex bites down on its neck and using its own weight it slams the unlucky Edmontosaurus to the ground and crushes its neck. T.rex would need to take down prey as fast as possible in order to reduce the risk of injury.

One of the most fascinating injuries is a Tyrannosaurus that had part of its tail bitten off, this specimen is known as Wyrex. As mentioned before; T.rex needed its tail for balance and the muscles that T.rex used to walk were connected to the tail. The fact that Wyrex was able to survive with half of its tail missing brings into question how this missing portion of the tail affected the way it walked post-injury. But how and why did these violent interactions come to be? Well, it might be anything from territorial disputes, food disputes, or battles over mating rights. All these injuries show that T.rex was very active and was a violent animal. To sum this all up, T.rex was a very successful predator and completely dominated its diverse ecosystem. Their physiology was perfectly built for its environment and it used its weight to its own advantage and was able to efficiently take down prey.

This tradition of children visiting houses in their neighborhood and being given, food or money became known as \"going a-souling.\""}],"markDefs":[],"style":"normal"},{"_sanityAsset":"image@file://./images/2979af9c69f50f4c4f2cc6bccdc10e175c093ef8-1600x1067.jpg","_key":"d7a9cf89217c","_type":"mainImage","alt":"Girl on a bench","caption":"Girl on a bench"},{"_key":"97a79510e06f","_type":"block","children":[{"_key":"97a79510e06f0","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"Dressing in costume for Halloween has European and Celtic roots. Hundreds of years ago, winter was an eery time since food usually ran low and on Halloween people thought they might encounter spirits if they left their homes. To avoid being recognized by them people wore masks when they left their homes after dark so that the ghosts would mistake them for spirits.

For these friendly spirits, they set places at the dinner table, left treats on doorsteps and lit candles to help them find their way back to the spirit world. Today's ghosts are depicted as fearsome and violent. And the superstitions that follow are scarier too. One of which explains why we avoid black cats, for fear that they will bring bad luck.
